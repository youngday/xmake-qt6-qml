# xmake-qt6-qml

ðŸ”‘ xmake qt6 qml quick  demo 

## goal

We want to  program ui by c++ ,for devices.
But,qt5 is himself play with qmake ,c++11,creator.
Now we have qt6,with cmake c++17,but we just want do ui with creator,like frontend part.
We do not want program cmakelist, creator for backend part.
So,we just use xmake to replace cmake,qml for frontend,c++17 for backend,we just want devices can be used easily,and develop easily.

## demo

* just install xmake ,c++ plugin in vscode,and run xmake targets for qml,like quickcontrols2,demos,quick3d,datavisualize,multimedia.

* for example,if you want program quick3d,change xmake-quick3d.lua into xmake.lua,
run xmake
* have a good start.

## note 

ðŸŽ¶ xmake for qt6 have a little complex steps , leave issues for me, just do it easily.

## todo

just a demo template , 
just fix issues of  xmake ,qml and c++17(c++20).
